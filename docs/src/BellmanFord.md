#Bellman Ford

**Definition (Wikipedia)** 

*The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers*

function bellmanford(A, s, n)

*computes the shortest path from a source node. Takes the matrix A, the source node s and the number of nodes n*
